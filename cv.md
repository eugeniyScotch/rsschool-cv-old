## About Myself

*****

My name is Eugene and I’m a student of Minsk State Linguistic University, where I’ve been studying such foreign languages as English and German for 5 years so far. However, I have been seeking for new opportunities of getting knowledge during the whole period of education. Thus, I applied for as many scholarship programs as I could find. I participated in some educational seminars and extra courses. It’s appeared though that it was not only knowledge I was seeking for, but also the communication itself.
